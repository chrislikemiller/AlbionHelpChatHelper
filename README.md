# Albion Help Chat Helper


Designed to answer questions repeatedly asked in chat, with the option to tag the player you are answering.

Made by Mesterke (MOD).


Example:

1. Add new entry in the application, assign an ID you will find it by and the text you want to be pasted as the answer.

2. Double click the item in the list. In the popup you can enter the playername you are answering, and the result text will be appended at the front of your text, e.g. "@player123 The answer is ..."  (Note: You can also skip entering anything, and the text will be unchanged.)

3. Pressing enter or clicking the button will copy the text onto your clipboard, so you can paste it ingame.
